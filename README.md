Using the dataset “bank_customer_analytics.csv” we prepare the data for a Machine Learning model:

 • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We Conduct an in-depth EDA to understand the data's characteristics, including summaries, 
distributions, and correlations. 
 • Handle Missing Data: We Identify any missing values and analyze their patterns.
 • Feature Selection: We Apply basic feature selection techniques to identify the most important columns.
 • Prepare Final Dataset: We Create a clean, processed dataset with selected features and save it in a new csv.
